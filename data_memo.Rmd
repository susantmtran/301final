## [**Project Timeline**]{style="color: #AC3B61"}

The due dates are April 21st for an exploratory data analysis and June 12th for the completed project. Given these deadlines, we expect to have our data set loaded into R by \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_. We will start our analysis on \_\_\_\_\_\_\_ and begin to create our predictive model by \_\_\_\_\_\_\_.

## [**The Data Set**]{style="color: #AC3B61"}

We are using the \_\_\_\_\_\_\_ data set from \_\_\_\_\_\_, which documents \_\_\_\_\_\_\_. It contains \_\_\_ observations, but we will be focusing on \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ for our analysis.
