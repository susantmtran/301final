## [**Project Timeline**]{style="color: #AC3B61"}

The due dates are April 21st for an exploratory data analysis and June 12th for the completed project. Given these deadlines, we expect to have our data set loaded into R by Wednesday, April 14th. We will start our analysis as soon as possible after that and will begin to create our predictive model by the end of April. That leaves us with about a month and a half to create different models, evaluate their performance, and draw a conclusion about the data set and a model that might be the "best" fit.
